   git clone https://github.com/ayan-11/Covid-Death-Analysis.git
   cd Covid-Death-Analysis
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the dataset and place it in the `dataset/` directory.

4. Run the Jupyter notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Covid-Death-Analysis.ipynb
   ```

## Visualizations

The Matplotlib library is extensively used to create insightful visualizations. Examples of plots include line charts, bar graphs, scatter plots, and many more. These visualizations aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.
